**Link to project:** https://raymond-rapper-api-b82af4f2d15a.herokuapp.com/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, JavaScript, Node.js, Express Framework

## Optimizations
Node Modules is included in .gitignore file, so run `npm install` in terminal after cloning or downloading the project to receive dependencies. 

## Lessons Learned:

Added toLowerCase() is important to handle case-sensitive entries. Also, I had to added process.env in order to host on Heroku.

## Examples:
Take a look at some info for 21 Savage and Chance the Rapper
